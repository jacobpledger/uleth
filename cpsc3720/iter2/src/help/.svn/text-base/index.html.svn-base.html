<h2><a name="Notation">Notation</a></h2>
The following is a description of the logical symbols used throughout this program. 
Truth in these cases means one of the variables is equal to 1, false meaning a variable is equal to 0.<br>
A'  - NOT A, the negation of A<br>
A+B - A OR B, true if one of either A is true, B is true or both are true<br>
A*B - A AND B, true only if both A and B are true.<br>
A^B - A XOR B, true if either A is true, or B is true, but not both.
Brackets are used the same as in mathematics, to delineate compund terms and change the order of operations.

<h2><a name="Input">Input</a></h2>
To begin, select File, New…
This will bring up a dialog box requesting you to select your input type. 
You can choose between Truth Table, KMap, or Boolean Expression from the drop down menu. 
When you have made your choice, press OK. Or press Cancel to quit.
All dialog windows contain a field to enter desired number of variables and variable names. 
You can type in the number of variables you want, or use the arrows to increment the counter. 
Variable names can be up to 2 letters (CAPS or lowercase, alphabetic characters only). 
If you change the names, you must click Save Names for them to be changed in the output.

<h3><a name="Entering a Truth Table">Entering a Truth Table</a></h3>
The Truth table is displayed top to bottom in binary order. 
Minterm numbers are listed on the left hand side of the table. 
To change an output value, simply click on the corresponding button in the far right column of the table. 
The button will cycle from 0, to 1, to X, and back to 0, changing once each click. 
When you have entered your desired truth values, press submit data.

<h3><a name="Entering a KMap">Entering a KMap</a></h3>
The KMap is displayed the same as a regular KMap. 
The variable names corresponding to each axis on the KMap are labeled on their respective sides. 
The respective values of those variables in each particular row and column are labeled at the top of each column and the left side of each row. 
For example, A,B 00 means that A and B are equal to 0, alternatively written A'B'. 
To change a value in the KMap, simply click the corresponding button. 
The button will cycle through 0, 1, X, and back to 0, changing once each click. 
When you have entered your desired KMap values, press submit data.

<h3><a name="Entering a Boolean Expression">Entering a Boolean Expression</a></h3>
Simply type the equation of the function you would like to simplify. 
See <a href="#Notation">Notation</a> for help on which logical symbols to use. 
In order to obtain accurate results, you must use the variable names you enter, or the default variable names provided. 
If other variable names are used, the program will simply tell you that the function is always true. 
(You will see the truth table final column and KMap filled with 1's, and the SOP/POS fields will read "1")

<h3><a name="Modifying Input">Modifying Input</a></h3>
If you wish to edit your previously entered input, click on File, and select Modify. 
You will be prompted to select which type of input you wish to modify from a drop down menu. 
Make your choice and press OK. The corresponding input window will appear with its current values. 
You can edit the input the same way you entered it initially. See <a href="#Input">Input</a>.

<h3><a name="Importing From a PLA File">Importing From a PLA File</a></h3>
KMapper is able to import a truth table from a .pla (programmable logic array) file. 
If you wish to import a file, simply click File, Import. 
This will bring up a file browser requesting you to select the file. 
When you have located the file, simply double click it, or select it and click Open. 
This will load the truth table and the program will automatically generate a minimal solution.<br>
See <a href="#Output">Output</a>

<h2><a name="Output">Output</a></h2>
To view the output, simply click the Submit Data button, after entering your desired input. 
The program will do the necessary calculations and output it in one of the following formats.

<h3><a name="Truth Table">Interpreting the Truth Table</a></h3>
The x-1 columns from the left are individual variable values. 
Each row is a term, a combination of these individual variables. 
The terms are sequenced in binary order, read top to bottom. 
These can also be read as minterms or maxterms 0 to x, top to bottom, 
with maxterms being the locations with 0's in the final column, and minterms being the locations with 1's in the final column.
The final column of the truth table is the corresponding truth value of the function, given each term. 
In other words, the 1's in the final column of the table show all combinations of variables (ANDed together), that cause the function to be equal to 1. 
The 0's in the final column of the table show all combinations of variables (ANDed together), that cause the function to be equal to 0.

<p>
<h3><a name="KMap">Interpreting the KMap</a></h3>
The KMap displays similarly to a regular KMap. The 1's are your minterms and the zeroes are your maxterms. 
The corresponding variables and their respective values are located around the outer edges of the KMap. 
The blue area indicates groupings of minterms, which are grouped in powers of 2. 
Minterms belonging to multiple overlapping groups are shaded darker. 
Shaded regions indicate where simplification has occurred. 
For every 2 variables in a group, a term eliminates 1 variable from the simplified equation.

<p>
<h3><a name="Boolean Expression">Interpreting the Boolean Expression</a></h3>
The SOP (Sum of Products) field displays the simplified Boolean expression as a Sum of Products. 
In other words, it is the simplified output from the groupings of the 1's on the KMap and Truth Table. 
As the name implies, the terms consist of the variables being multiplied (ANDed) together. 
Those terms are then ORed together to create the function.
<br><br>
The POS (Product of Sums) field displays the simplified Boolean expression as a Product of Sums.
In other words, it is the simplified output from the groupings of the 0's on the KMap and Truth Table. 
In this case, the terms consist of the variables being ORed together. 
Those terms are then ANDed together to create the function.
<br><br>
The two are logically equivalent.

<h3><a name="Exporting to a PLA File">Exporting to a PLA File</a></h3>
Once you have generated a solution (See <a href="#Input">Input</a>), you may export the truth table that corresponds to that solution to a .pla (programmable logic array) file. 
Generate a solution, and then go to File, Export. 
This will bring up a file browser asking you to name the file and select the directory in which to save it. 
When you have selected these, simply click Save.
